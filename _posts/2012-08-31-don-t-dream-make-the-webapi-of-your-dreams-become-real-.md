A: "Dammit, we can't do this on the web :("
B: "You know, it's called the open web - you can change it!"
A: "I can't just fork the web from GitHub and make it do the things I want."
B: "Haha, no, it's not that simple. But you can talk to some people and if they think your API makes sense, get a browser project from GitHub and they will help you to implement your new API."
A: "But then it's just in one browser, not the web?"
B: "You got to start somewhere."
A: "Right... Can you help me get going?"
B: "Sure!"

Implementing competitive printing support for PDF.JS is not possible with the current state of the web. Therefore, I started to work on some new `mozPrintCallback` API. 

In this talk, I will share my experience with proposing a new API, how to implement it in a browser and how even hacking C++ code can be fun.

<img src="/images/relax.js-banner.png" alt="relax.js"/><br/>

**We hate goodbyes.** We understand you probably have to head home though. What better way to bid farewell to new found JS friends than over strong coffee, mimosas, eggs, bacon and [matjes][matjes]<small>*</small>? What's more, we've picked a location that is just a couple minutes on foot from Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Central Station). When it does come time to part company, you will be well provided for with transport options.

relax.js will take place at the [Zollpackhof Restaurant][zollpackhof], just across the river from the official home of German Chancellor [Angela Merkel][merkel].

<small>* of course other food choices available, including Vegetarian options.</small>

## The Practicalities (or getting home)

We really don't want to see you leave. _Did we mention that already?_  But the following information may help you arrive rested and unflustered:

### your baggage

If you have heavy bags with you, we recommend you leave them in one of the lockers at Hauptbahnhof. Lockers are available on the first floor (second floor, if you're from the U.S.). Look for the signs for _Schliessfächer_ (or see the [station map][hauptbahnhof_map]).

### leaving on a train

The Zollpackhaus Restaurant is located 5 minutes from Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Europe's largest railway station. Consult the [Deutsche Bahn][bahn_EN] (German Railways) for schedules and real-time arrivals and departure information.

### leaving on a plane

Regardless of the airport you're flying out from, you should find it straightforward to catch your flight (if you're unsure of whether you fly from Tegel or Schönefeld, [check this airline list][ber_which_airport_EN]).

#### Berlin Tegel Airport (TXL)

The fastest way to Tegel is travelling with the **JetExpressBus TXL**. The bus service runs every 5 minutes and normally takes 20 minutes from Hauptbahnhof. There are bus stops for TXL on both the south and north sides of the station (Washingtonplatz, Europaplatz).

A standard VBB ticket for Fare Zone AB will suffice.

#### Berlin Schönefeld Airport (SXF)

The easiest way to reach Schönefeld Airport from Hauptbahnhof is by **Regional Bahn/Express** trains. Journeys take about half an hour. Take either **RB14** and **RE7**:

- RB14 departs at 10 minutes past the hour (i.e. 11:10, 12:10, 13:10, 14:10, 15:10, 16:10, etc.), taking 31 minutes.
- RE7 departs at 45 minutes past the hour (i.e. 11:45, 12:45, 13:45, 14:45, 15:45, 16:45, etc.), taking 28 minutes.

Trains to Schönefeld normally depart from Platform _(Gleis)_ 12. You will need a ticket for VBB Fare Zone C.

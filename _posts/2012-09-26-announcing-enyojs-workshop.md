We are happy to announce that HP is running an Enyo Workshop on Friday, October 5th, 13:00-17:00

Interested in creating cross-platform, mobile Web Applications with Javascript? See how the 
free and open-source Framework Enyo can help you to focus on Javascript, Components and Encapsulation
when writing Web and Mobile Applications. 

This will be an hands-on Workshop, so expect less talk and more action :)
